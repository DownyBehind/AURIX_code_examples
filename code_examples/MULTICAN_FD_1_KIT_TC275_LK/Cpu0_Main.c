 /*\title MULTICAN FD data transmission
 * \abstract MULTICAN in Flexible Data-Rate mode is used to exchange data between two nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description The CAN messages are sent from CAN node 0 to CAN node 1 using Loop-Back mode.
 *              Both CAN nodes are set to CAN Flexible Data-rate mode (CAN FD). After each CAN message
 *              transmission and successful reception, an interrupt is generated. Inside the interrupt service routine,
 *              the content of the received CAN message is read. In case of the successful read operation, the
 *              received data is compared to the transmitted data. If all messages are received without any error
 *              detected, the LED is turned on to confirm successful message reception.
