 /*\title MULTICAN RX FIFO data transmission
 * \abstract MULTICAN is used to exchange data using RX FIFO structure between two nodes, implemented in the same device using Loop-Back mode.
 * \description The CAN messages are sent from CAN node 0 over CAN bus (in case of Loop-Back mode all nodes can access
 *              the internal bus). CAN node 1 receives the transmitted messages and stores them inside of RX FIFO
 *              buffer structure. Once the RX FIFO buffer threshold value has been reached, an interrupt service
 *              request is generated. CPU 1 handles the interrupt service request and reads the received CAN messages
 *              from the RX FIFO buffer. The content of the received data will be compared to the content of the
 *              transmitted CAN messages and in case of success, an LED is turned on to confirm the message reception.
