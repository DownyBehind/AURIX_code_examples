 /*\title Auto Scan of ADC channel
 * \abstract The Versatile Analog-to-Digital Converter (VADC) is configured to measure multiple analog signals in a sequence using  scan request.
 * \description The Auto Scan mode of the Versatile Analog to Digital Converter (VADC) module is enabled over the
 *              channels 0 to 4 of the Group 0. Additionally, the converted results are checked with the
 *              Valid Flag (VF) of the Result Register, and then sent to the PC via UART.
